# livestream-viewer

A quickly hacked together google map with markers that open live streams on youtube at the location.

I basically hacked it out of this: http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/infowindow_custom/infowindow-custom.html - I did not spend any time cleaning that messy code up.

Some stuff to do:

 - Make it so videos have their own dedicated portion of the page, so you can pan the earth map without closing your livestream
 - Implement some sort of crowdsource addition to the list so viewers can update new streams and remove dead ones
 - clean up the UI
